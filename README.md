### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Kai a passionate self-taught front-end web developer, with a keen interest in information visualization and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I love to experiment with new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems or **just for fun**.
<br/>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)
- 👯 I’m actively looking for collaboration on [Qwerty Learner](https://github.com/Kaiyiwing/qwerty-learner), let's make keyboard learning a blast together!!
- 🪄 Outside of coding, I have a passion for magic tricks, always eager to add a touch of mystery and wonder to life.
- 📝 In my coding journey, I've been lucky enough to work at prestigious firms like [HULU(Disney Streaming)](https://hulu.com), [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), and [Ke Holdings](https://investors.ke.com/), where I gained a wealth of experience in my field.
